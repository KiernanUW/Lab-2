This work is of geo-located tweets in the United States. The keyword I was checking for was "Spring" during the morning and during the afternoon. While it was not the intention, this does exclude Hawaii and Alaska because no one tweeted in relation to my search term during the crawlers run time. I picked this comparison because of the weather that we have been having in Seattle, where it gets cold, wet, hot, and dry all in the same wacky day, and was curious how others in the country felt about the arrival of spring.
